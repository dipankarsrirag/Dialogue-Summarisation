#person1#: well, mike, nowadays there is much talk about nanometer. but what on earth is it? #person2#: nanometer is a length scale. it's one billionth of a meter, roughly ten times the size of an individual atom. #person1#: hmm... it is hard to figure out the exact size, i am afraid. #person2#: well, let us make it this way. for comparison, 10 nm is 1000 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair. there are as many nanometers in an inch as there are inches in 400 miles. #person1#: i see. thank you. <sos> mike explains the concept of nanometer to #person1#. #person1# understands it. <eos>

#person1#: i like chess better than xiangqi. and you? #person2#: for my part, xiangqi. maybe it is because my girlfriend is chinese. #person1#: i think chess is more reasonable. you see, each side has eight pawns, a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi. a true battle should be like that. soldiers should outnumber the commanders. #person2#: quite right. and unlike the soldiers in xiangqi, the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank. it is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance. #person1#: correct! another contrast is the rules for the general and the king. it seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent. they are required to stay in the palace, waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards. look at the king in chess, he is much more capable. #person2#: yeah, and though the king in chess does not have bodyguards, he has a queen who is the most powerful piece. i think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval europe than in china. #person1#: there's another distinctive contrast. both board games use a total of 32 pieces, but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board, bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess. #person2#: you mean, xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around? #person1#: sure. on a chessboard, fire is much more intensive. it has a smaller board, while those bigger pieces - chariots, horses and bishops - can cover longer distances. <sos> #person1# and #person2# discuss the differences between chess and xiangqi. both of them think chess is more reasonable than xiangqi in certain rules, but #person1# think xiangqi has a larger space in which to move around. <eos>
#person1#: well, this is a pleasant surprise. it seems to me we ran into each other here last week too. #person2#: you and i must have the same idea. the only way to beat the crowds when you do the grocery shopping on saturday is to be here when they open at 9 : 00 of the clock sharp! <sos> #person1# and #person2# run into each other again at the grocery. <eos>
#person1#: john, shall we go to sun store? i have decided to buy that murrberry handbag. anyway, i'm not carrying this one to mary's wedding. #person2#: but, jane, why not rent one with handbag hire? instead of $ 990, pay $ 50, and you have it for a whole week. #person1#: sounds great, but i never knew i can rent a handbag. #person2#: handbag hire is a new business. it was founded two months ago. its collection covers many designer handbags. #person1#: so... for the price of one murrberry, i can use a different bag each week for twenty weeks? #person2#: absolutely. and if you like one of them, you can choose to buy it at a discounted rate. of course the price varies by age and condition. for example, a $ 1500 murrberry bag can sell for just $ 750. #person1#: great, but how do i rent? by telephone? or in person? #person2#: either. and more conveniently, it accepts online orders. #person1#: i will do it on line now. i still have one more question. mary's wedding is next saturday. there are only five days left. do i have enough time? #person2#: don't worry. it promises that customers receive their orders by post within two days. three more days to go. #person1#: oh, i would better order one right now. <sos> jane wants to buy that murrberry handbag to carry to mary's wedding, but john suggests renting one with handbag hire and tells her about the service in detail. jane is pleased to have a try. <eos>

#person1#: dear audiences, today we will talk about divorce and its effect on children. our guest is jennifer benzes. thank you for coming, jennifer. do you mind saying something about your divorce? #person2#: no. i got divorced years ago. even worse, i got divorced when i had small children. #person1#: have you thought of the effect divorce may have on your children? their needs can be forgotten as parents are struggling to re - establish their lives. #person2#: of course, we have. we are definitely more aware of the impact on children. after all we are not famous people who trade spouses like shoes. for most of us divorce is not entered into lightly. we all suffer. anyway, we try to comfort our children. #person1#: how? #person2#: we tell them we love them and will always do. #person1#: you have not thought of saving the marriage? #person2#: yes, we have. we would do anything to spare our children pain. but you know, fixing a marriage is not like changing a tire. family conflicts may take hold like a cancer. #person1#: then divorce is the only way to get rid of it. #person2#: it's true with me. others may succeed in fixing. #person1#: yet most people believe a hard marriage is better for children than a divorce. according to a recent poll, more people today think parents should stay together for the sake of the children what do you think? #person2#: i think the cost of staying together is worse than the benefits. parents quarreling and fighting all day may do more harm to their children. #person1#: what do you want society to do for you? #person2#: understand us, not curse us. more importantly, they should help us share the loss and build a better future. <sos> jennifer benzes is sharing her divorce and its impact on her children with the audience. she thinks fixing a marriage is not better for children though most people think the opposite and she wants society to understand them instead of cursing them. <eos>
